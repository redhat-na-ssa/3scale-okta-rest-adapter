= 3scale to Okta REST Adapter

:numbered:

This project demonstrates a RESTful integration adapter between Red Hat 3scale and Okta.
More specifically, it facilitates the synchonrization of 3scale _applications_ and Okta SSO _applications_.


*DISCLAIMER:*  This project is provided for demonstration purposes only.  If/when technical or architectural assistance is needed, please contact your Red Hat sales representative to collaboate with Red Hat Consulting to develop and maintain a custom integration between 3scale and Okta for your organization.

== Background

3scale API Manager provides the ability to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.13/html-single/administering_the_api_gateway/index#integrating-threescale-with-an-openid-connect-identity-provider[Integrate with an OpenID Connect Identity Provider].

Red Hat SSO is that recommended Identity Provider.

Some customers of 3scale, however, may prefer to use other identity providers, such as Okta.
Integration between 3scale and Okta is possible however it requires tedious manual synchronization between the two systems when 3scale API _applications_ change (ie: create, update, delete) over time.
This project demonstrates an automated synchronization between 3scale and Okta.

In this project, you will build and deploy an integration app that runs in your OpenShift cluster (co-located with your 3scale API Manager).  This integration app is implemented using Red Hat Fuse embedded in a SpringBoot based linux container.  All interaction between 3scale -> Integration App -> Okta is via REST.


== Pre-reqs:

. *OpenShift cluster* ( >= v 4.10 )

. link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/?C=M;O=D[oc utility]
+
Needs to correspond to the version of your OpenShift cluster. 
+
You should be authenticated into your OpenShift cluster at the command line as either _cluster-admin_ or an admin user of your namespace.

. *3scale API Manager* ( >= v 2.11 )
+
3scale operator along with _apimanager_ and _tenant_ resources should be installed on your OpenShift cluster.  You should be authenticated into 3scale as the administrator of your tenant.

. *Okta Developer Account*

.. Sign up for one at https://developer.okta.com/signup/.
.. From the _admin_ page of your Okta account, make note of your Okta _subdomain_ found at the top right corner.
+
Your subdomain will be of the format:   _okta-dev-XXXXXXXX_ .

.. Set the following environment variable in your shell:
+
-----
export OKTA_SUBDOMAIN=<change_me>
-----

. *JDK / Maven*
+
This project requires JDK 11 (or more recent) with the _javac_ compiler.
+
In addition, maven 3.6.3 (or more recent) is also needed.

== Okta Token
You will need an Okta token with sufficient privileges to create SSO _applications_ in Okta.

. Follow the instructions found link:https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/main/#oauth-2-0-instead-of-api-tokens[here] to create this token.

. Make note of the _Token Value_ as found in the pop-up:

+
-----
export OKTA_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=<change_me>
-----

.  Okta Credentials Secret:
+
From the root of this project, execute the following:
+
-----
echo "apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: okta-credentials
  labels:
    app: 3scale-okta-rest-adapter
    application: 3scale-okta-rest-adapter
type: Opaque
stringData:
  issuer: https://$OKTA_SUBDOMAIN.okta.com/oauth2/default
  org-url: https://$OKTA_SUBDOMAIN.okta.com
  access-token: $OKTA_ACCOUNT_TOKEN" \
  | oc apply -n $OKTA_INTEGRATION_NS -f -
-----

. Other OpenShift resources:
+
Execute the following:
+
```bash
oc apply -f .openshift/01-imagestream.yaml -n $OKTA_INTEGRATION_NS
oc apply -f .openshift/02-buildconfig.yaml -n $OKTA_INTEGRATION_NS
oc apply -f .openshift/04-deploymentconfig.yaml -n $OKTA_INTEGRATION_NS
oc apply -f .openshift/05-service.yaml -n $OKTA_INTEGRATION_NS
```

==== Compile

```bash
./mvnw clean verify
```

==== Deploy

```bash
oc start-build 3scale-okta-rest-adapter --from-file=target/threescale-okta-rest-adapter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --follow -n $OKTA_INTEGRATION_NS
oc rollout latest dc/3scale-okta-rest-adapter -n $OKTA_INTEGRATION_NS
oc rollout status dc/3scale-okta-rest-adapter -n $OKTA_INTEGRATION_NS --watch
```

=== Okta Application

In Okta, create a new `API Services` application and retain the client ID and client secret for use
later when configuring 3scale to use this integration adapter.

. From your Okta admin page, navigate to: `Applications -> Applications -> Create App Integration`.
. In the pop-up, select _API Services_ and click `Next`:
+
image::docs/images/okta_api_services.png[]

. In the next form, provide a name of:  _zync_integration_
. Make note of both the `Client ID` as well as the `Client Secret`
+
image::docs/images/okta_client_details.png[]

. Set the following variables in your shell:
+
-----
export ZYNC_CLIENT_ID=<change_me>
export ZYNC_CLIENT_SECRET=<change_me>
-----

== 3scale Configs

Configure an API product in 3scale with the following _Authentication_ settings:

. **Authentication**: OpenID Connect Use OpenID Connect for any OAuth 2.0 flow.
. **OpenID Connect Issuer Type**: `REST API`

. *OpenID Connect Issuer*:
+
Populate with the output of the following:
+
-----
echo -en "\nhttp://$ZYNC_CLIENT_ID:$ZYNC_CLIENT_SECRET@threescale-okta-rest-adapter.$OKTA_INTEGRATION_NS.svc/\n"
-----

. **ClientID Token Claim Type**: `plain`
. **ClientID Token Claim**: `cid`

== Usage

Synchronization between 3scale and Okta is uni-directional:  all state changes are initiated in 3scale and synchronized with Okta.  The reverse is not possible.

Once your API product has been configured, create a 3scale _application_ that references that _product_.

If all is set-up correctly, a corresponding SSO _application_ with the same name will have been created in Okta.

* Okta app
+
image::docs/images/okta_3scale_int_1.png[]

* 3scale app
+
image::docs/images/okta_3scale_int_2.png[]

You will also have the ability to update that _application_ from 3scale.

== Implementation Notes

=== OAuth Clients are Okta Applications

Okta maintains OAuth/OIDC clients as part of the Okta "Application" list.
Because of this, applications created by this integration app may need to have
users or groups assigned to them before they can be used to create tokens.

=== Grant Type Restrictions

By default, Okta imposes a strict limitation on the grant types allowed for
each "application type". This 3scale-Okta integration tool attempts to automatically select
the Okta application type (web, native, service) depending upon the grant types
requested by 3scale.

The logic that selects the Okta app type is found in link:src/main/java/com/redhat/consulting/zyncadapter/mappers/ApplicationMapper.java[ApplicationMapper.java]

=== Scope Grants

Okta's management API is very unclear on scope grants to applications. On
the one hand, it seems like the intent is for generalized scopes to be
configured at the Authorization Server level, but on the other, almost all the
default scopes are specific to managing aspects of Okta configuration.

In addition, the API for interacting with scopes seems very immature. For
example: to grant a scope to an application, the request must include both
`issuer` and `scopeId` -- however these are misleading labels. The `issuer` is
not the Authorization Server's issuer value; instead, it is the general
organization URL for the whole Okta environment. Similarly, the key `scopeId`
is actually to be set with a value of the scope name and not the scope's ID.

Beyond the misleading labeling, Okta rejects scope grants with very little
detail for the reason: it states only `scopeId: 'scopeId' is invalid`. This
makes setting scopes for Service app types (`client_credentials`) almost
impossible.

Instead of setting scopes programmatically, it is easier to just define a scope
on the Okta Authorization Server and set it as a "default" scope. Then clients
will be able to generate tokens.

=== Caching

The Okta Java SDK automatically comes with in-memory caching configured for
production use. This is useful for individual deployments of apps like this.

When using the SDK in clustered deployment configurations, Okta recommends
changing the SDK's cache to use a proper clustered cache mechanism.
